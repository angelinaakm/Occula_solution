This project exposes a GET API to retrieve weather data and outputs some calculations based on the day and city.
Next steps to improve the code would be to host the container on cloud and create a CICD pipeline for deployment.
I would also add and refine more tests and modularise the code using different directories and classes.

To run the Docker image there would need to be an environment variable parameter included with the WeatherAPIKey.
